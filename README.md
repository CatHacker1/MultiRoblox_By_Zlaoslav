# MultiRoblox â€” Build and Safety Note

I rebuilt and consolidated the MultiRoblox program with the assistance of ChatGPT. The source code I provided and distributed has been modified to be compatible with MinGW/MSYS2 and to compile as a single-file executable.

I affirm that the distributed source code does not contain any malicious code or viruses. If you have any doubts about the binary, you may verify by building the executable yourself from source.

**If you want to build the executable yourself** follow the instructions in `GUIDE.txt` included with this project. Building with MSYS2/MinGW ensures the binary is created from the source code you can audit.

**Notes**

- I used ChatGPT to refactor and merge the original files into a single C source file and to adapt the strings for MinGW compilation.
- You are encouraged to inspect the source code yourself before building.
- If you find anything suspicious, do not run the binary. Build from source using `GUIDE.txt` or open an issue on the GitHub repository above.
